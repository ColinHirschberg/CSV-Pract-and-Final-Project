#Section 1: In order to implement or wield the scrapeVerlanTweets.py to garner Tweets from Twitter, install pandas and the snscrape packages in the Repl.it 
#bash shell, not in the python interpreter. The shell defaults to bash mode until "python" is typed in a commandline.
pip install pandas
pip3 install git+https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape.git

#Section 2: Iterate through a list of verlan words, and for each verlan word detected, append the tweet featuring the verlan word to a new list.'

#of metadata of the Tweets and a column carrying the content of the Tweets.

#Section 4: Apply the .head() method or .tail() method to display the first five entries of the dataframe or the final five entries of the dataframe, respectively.
